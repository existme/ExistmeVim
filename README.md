My personal zsh/vim dot files
---------------------------------------
My attempt to organize zsh and vim configuration and tricks to get it working on 
different computer with different operating systems

This repo includes several submodules as vim and zsh plugins, it also contains
scripts in bin folder which are written either by me or I have stolen them from
good fellows, I didn't keep track of all of the copied scripts but at somepoint
tried to keep the references to the scripts and original authors. (sorry if some
are used uncredited)
