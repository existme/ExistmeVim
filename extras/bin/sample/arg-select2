# select name [ in word ] ; do list ; done
# The list of words following in is expanded, generating a list of items. The set of expanded words
# is printed on the standard error, each preceded by a number. If the in word is omitted, the posi-
# tional parameters are printed (see PARAMETERS below). The PS3 prompt is then displayed and a
# line read from the standard input. If the line consists of a number corresponding to one of the dis-
# played words, then the value of name is set to that word. If the line is empty, the words and
# prompt are displayed again. If EOF is read, the command completes. Any other value read causes
# name to be set to null. The line read is saved in the variable REPLY. The list is executed after
# each selection until a break command is executed. The exit status of select is the exit status of the
# last command executed in list, or zero if no commands were executed.
